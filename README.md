Javalabra 2013

I think of making an Arcade like game hall, where you can choose some of the most popular old arcade games. I've also thought about adding functionality for people to add their own games inside a game folder (still have to figure out how to load class files from their file name, through a ClassLoader)



List of games included
----------------------
  * Pacman




Miscellaneous

Using LWJGL as the connection to hardware accelerated graphics... Might be a little overkill in this project, but it gives higher framerates! =D OpenGL would also be a good way for adding nice shading effects...
